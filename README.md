# College-Finder-Spring
This is an implementation of my already existing "Rails-college-finder" repository using Java and the Spring Framework

Upon visiting the homepage the user will see a few clickable links on the NavBar on the top of the page.</br></br>
Colleges: Clicking on this will let the user see a list of every college that is stored in the database of this app</br></br>
Programs: This will render a list of the categories of majors that the user can search by</br></br>
Advanced Search: </br>
-This page will render a form for users to enter their SAT **OR** ACT score. Users can enter both if they please.</br>
-Select your program of study in the dropdown menu.</br>
-Enter the abbreviation of the state(USA only) that you are looking to study in.</br>
-If there are any results, the user should get brought to a page that renders the all of the resulting colleges names, locations, and yearly tuition.</br>
